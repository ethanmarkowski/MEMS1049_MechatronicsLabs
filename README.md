# MEMS1049_MechatronicsLabs

The content in this repository showcases some of the embedded system work that I completed as part of the MEMS 1049 - Mechatronics course at the University of Pittsburgh. This mechanical engineering course is focused on the construction and programming of mechatronic systems and the user of the Atmel ATmega328P microcontroller.
