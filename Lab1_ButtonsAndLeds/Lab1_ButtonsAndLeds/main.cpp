/*
This program is a solution to Lab 1 -- 
	Pushbutton switches are connected to Pins PD3 and PD4 (pulled high when switch is open).
	LEDs are connected to Pins PD6 and PD7 (active low). 
	
	The program causes the LEDs to mimic the input pin states (i.e. when Pin PD3 is high, the LED connected to Pin PD6 is on.  Likewise for Pins PD4 and PD7).
